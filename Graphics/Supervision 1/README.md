# Supervision 1 Questions

## Warm up questions

1. `i = 3(hx+y)`
2. Sampling is when a continuous signal is measured in discrete time intervals, while the measured values may still be continuous. Quantization is when measured values of a signal are rounded to discrete values.
3. 
4. When tracing rays from the eye, one can trace one ray from the eye through each pixel of the screen in order to determine what colour each pixel should be, thereby achieving the maximum resolution your display will allow. If instead a ray is traced from the scene, there's no guarantee it will even reach the eye. As such, it is difficult to know how many rays to trace and from which parts of the screen they should originate in order to determine the colour of every pixel in the display.
